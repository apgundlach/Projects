Brief Description of Project 2

For project 2, I created a QuerySearcher class in order to take a query file given
by the user, break up the words in the query file and find exact and partial matches
to the query word from the inverted index created in project 1.
The SearchResults object was created in order to do a comparison for the ordering 
of the frequency of the query word and the first position.  It is also used
to output desired results.
